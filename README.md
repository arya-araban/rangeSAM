# RangeSAM: Promptable Segmentation of Sparse 3D Point Clouds

![RangeSAM Architecture](./images/arch.png)

RangeSAM is a novel architecture designed for 3D promptable point cloud segmentation, specifically tailored to address the challenges of sparse LiDAR data in outdoor driving scenes. By integrating range-based processing techniques with transformer architectures from state-of-the-art 2D promptable segmentation models, RangeSAM effectively handles sparse and irregular LiDAR data while maintaining high segmentation fidelity.

## Code
The public release of the code for RangeSAM is pending publication. If you're interested in accessing it beforehand, feel free to reach out to me directly. Iâ€™d be happy to discuss potential collaborations or provide early access where possible.
