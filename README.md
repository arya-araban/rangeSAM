# RangeSAM: Promptable Segmentation of Sparse 3D Point Clouds


![RangeSAM Architecture](./images/arch.png)

RangeSAM is a novel architecture designed for promptable point cloud segmentation, specifically tailored to address the challenges of sparse LiDAR data in outdoor driving scenes. By integrating range-based processing techniques with principles from state-of-the-art 2D promptable segmentation models, RangeSAM effectively handles sparse and irregular LiDAR data while maintaining high segmentation fidelity.
